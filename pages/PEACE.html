    <h2>Why do we seek Peace?</h2>
    <p>
Everyone seems to want peace, but what does it mean, from a biblical perspective, to truly seek peace. It is a question that, I believe, we struggle with answering. Part of this is because our first instinct, and understandably so, is to simply end the bullets from firing, from wars being instigated, and from people being killed. Our desire for the humanity of all people – regardless of what side of the war they are on – desires that lives to be protected. Yet, the other side of the coin is that, often, we’re not sure what it means to truly seek peace.
